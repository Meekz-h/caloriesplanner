Day 1 of project gamma and the group has already decided on an application idea. I'm confident in our idea and our ability to flesh it out. We've tested the api and have analyzed the data.

# 3/21/2023

We started the wireframe and got a good basis for what our app will look like.

# 3/22/2023

Worked on more documentation and API design. Went smoothly and worked out some of the kinks in our project.

# 3/23/2023

Worked on more documentation and figured out some more project details.

# 3/24/2023

Finished the API Documentation, looking forward to coding

# 3/27/2023

First day of actual coding. Was nervous going in but we got a lot done. We're working well and we're cohesive. We got docker-compose setup and the API started.

# 3/28/2023

Got authentication done. It's been going smooth and I've learned a lot.

# 3/29/2023

I was the coder today, and I implemented the 3rd party api and added in an update account method. We plan on getting it reviewed tomorrow.

# 3/30/2023

We finished backend and installed tailwinds ! looking forward to frontend monday

# 4/3/2023

We started the main page design and got some tailwind stuff into our project.

# 4/4/2023

Looking really good so far. Login form done, and frontend authentication has been completed.

# 4/17/2023

Break was good. Made really good progress on the log a meal page and having the form appear.

# 4/18/2023

We implemented the USDA api and got the form to submit, only the table left and the authorized main page :D.

# 4/19/2023

We got tested by the filter by categories today but we solved it! Everyone chipped in their ideas and solutions and we we're able to get a work around. Really enjoying the progress we've made thus far, and we're definitely on track to finish.

# 4/20/2023

We completed the filter by date. This was a unique issue as we had to convert the date object to a date string and filter the entry dates by them. We got it to work and got the layout for the authmain page settled.

# 4/24/2023

We completed the card components for the auth mainpage. They succesfully load the meals for each category. We'll tackle the charts tomorrow

# 4/25/2023

We created the google chart and implemeneted the 5 unit tests for the API. The test's we're a bit difficult to understand be we got it done as a team. All that's left is styling and getting the deliverable's sorted but we should be done after that. Really excited with what we've done and the app as a whole!

# 4/26/2023

A pretty relaxed day, we cleaned up the code and improved styling

# 4/27/2023

All the deliverables we're completed and this is probably my last journal entry. I've enjoyed every day working with this team and im proud of what we accomplished

# 4/28/2023

Submitting project today, just have to merge journals.
