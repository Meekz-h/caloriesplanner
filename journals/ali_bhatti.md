# WEEK 3: (Most of this week was done together as a group)
* 4/03: started front end work. We installed tailwind libraries and items as necessary. As a group discussed front end themes, templates, what we will use. We decided to start on the main page as a group together and then maybe in the future we will split up into teams as we work on other webpages. We want to wait for the front-end authentication lecture to drop before we begin coding on the other front-end pages that require authentication. Personally, I spent some time researching tailwind templates to get some inspiration and ideas to share with my group on how to code certain things.
* 4/04: continued work on front main page as a group and started work on front end authentication. As a group we have decided tomorrow we will sit down and review code of all our front end authentication because some of us (myself included) were a bit confused on some lines of code and whats going on.
* 4/05: continued work from previous day. Spent some of day reviewing code and understanding front end authentication.
* 4/06: finshed up all front end authentication work. Also created my own branch to code login page css and come up with some ideas on front end styling to show the team.
* 4/07:

# WEEK 4:
* 4/17: I led the zoom screen-share and together as a group we created the create and view meals page using react states. Overall I am happy with the progress. The coding was a bit difficult as I am rusty after the break but together we were able to make good progress.
* 4/18: Together, we created the meal log page and created the usda api connection and created a form to pull data from the website. We also added the submit button to send a post request and add a meal entry to the database.
* 4/19: Continued on meal log page and added a filtered table to show a users meal log filtered by breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack. Added some hover effects and cleaned up code too.

* 4/21: OFF

# WEEK 5:
* 4/24: Today I led the coding. The front main auth page (authorized) was worked on. I created 4 new js files for bfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, to create the cards and tables for each meal category and list the current days meal items.
* 4/25: Today we finished up the front main auth page (authorized user). We updated the graph, linked the data to the graph on the backend and formatted the graph to show the 7 day data that we want for calorie intake. We also worked on unit testing and cleaning up code. Each person has created a unit test, i created the update (PUT) unit test.

* 4/27: Today we did a practice demo with Riley and had any extra questions answered, we continued cleaning up code, creating issues, updating readme, making sure journals are up to date, etc. We worked a little on front end today as well just making things look pretty. We finished early and are pretty much done with the project until stretch goals, at which point we will just fork the repo and work on the app individually.
* 4/28: final submittal. DONE! Final merges in gitlab.
