# **Journal**

### day 1 (March 20/2023):

    1. - Code of conduct: This is the first thing we worked on in the group. We got to know each other and shared why we wanted to become developers and hobbies. After that, we shared how was the best way we learn new things, and also we discussed how we prefer to receive feedback, and finally wrote down our agreed preferences when working as a group
    2. - Module product ideation: We shared our ideas with the team, and each of us shared our point of view on the ideas and ended up choosing a doable cool idea in 5 weeks. Also we created the MVP for the project.
    3. - Pitch the idea to the instructors and got the OK: After break, the instructors came into our room, and Brian pitched the idea, and the instructor liked and approved the idea and gave us some input towards the next steps.
    4. - Try the API to make sure it works, and we have the information we need: We tried the API in insomnia to see the data we will have available, tested it on all our machines, and agreed on the data we will use.

### day 2 (March 21/2023):

    1. - Today, we spent most of the day working on lectures, career service, etc. At the end of the day, the team started working on the app's wireframes, which was a really good experience because we all got to share how we imagined the application and then discuss what we wanted to add to the design. We finished the main page for authenticated users and the main page for no authenticated users. We'll keep working tomorrow on it.
    2. - We discussed what CSS library we wanted to use for the project. We all agreed we wanted to try tailwinds, so we have more experience with another library
    3. - We started to discuss what database we would like to use for the project. We have yet to decide, but we all want to learn mango, so we have more expertise in a different one

### day 3 (March 22/2023):

    1. - Today we finished working on the wireframing designs, I feel we are on a good spot. We kinda started working on the logo, but that is going to be on hold on since is gonna be part of the front end. However, we have an option we might use for the project.
    2. - I am going through the API design requirements, and reading what we should start working tomorrow. Pretty much I feel happy with the way everybody is adding to the team.

### day 4 (March 23/2023):

    1. - Today, we started working on the API's design according to the requirements. I saw two different wireframes this morning, and our group requested feedback from Riley, and so far, we have a clearer idea.
    2. - I am a little worried because we have been able to touch the APIs at the time I am logging in to this journal because we were finishing the resume with a new rubric that didn't match the one released a few weeks ago, so we had to work on that for a while. We'll have a little time after 5 pm to work on that (hopefully)
    3. - Omar came into the room, and we shared with him the wireframe design, got feedback on that, and also we discussed the code of conduct, and we concluded that we have to finish discussing some stuff with the group, such as the roles, and the schedule during spring break.
